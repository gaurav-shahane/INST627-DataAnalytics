Project: The study of Effect of Higher Excise Tax on Smoking Behavior of Various Age Groups

<h2>Introduction</h2> 

As per the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, Smoking remains the primary cause of preventable deaths in the US, Killing an estimate of over 480,000 citizens each year. Government has taken up several initiatives to curb death and illnesses caused due chronic use of cigarettes. Along with a few direct initiatives, to target a bigger population of cigarette smokers, the government usually uses means of increasing excise tax on cigarette. Basis of their argument is making cigarette expensive will reduce its consumption and this is how they can address the entire issue of illnesses and death caused due to cigarette smoking. We want to study the impact of Excise Taxes on Cigarette on the smoking population in the United States.

Our rationale behind picking this problem was this: Let’s revisit the CDC data of more than 480,000 deaths caused due to smoking. By any standards that is a very big number and this is true for each year. Our study focuses on whether governments’ changes in state excise tax on cigarette are really effective on the ground level? Are the right things done and are they done to right extent to save some or more of these ‘preventable’ deaths. Through this project we look to study whether increasing taxes will have any effect on the smoking population? And will it affect each age group equally? To uncover the answers to these questions, we decided to take verify the relationship between taxation and behavior of smoking population belonging to various age groups in all the states of USA.
